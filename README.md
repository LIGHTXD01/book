**Library System**
A simple Library Management System built with Django to manage and display information about books, events, and other library-related data. The system provides an admin interface for managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books and events. The project also uses pipenv for managing dependencies.

**Features**
Book Management: Admin can add, update, delete, and view books in the library.
Event Management: Admin can add, update, delete, and view library events.
Admin Interface: Easy-to-use admin interface for managing the library's books and events.
**Database:**
Data is stored in a relational database, which is managed through Django's ORM.
Pipenv for Dependency Management: Uses pipenv to manage Python dependencies.
